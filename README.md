# Contrail_Detection_Deep_Learning
Contrails are the line-shaped ice clouds formed behind the aircrafts that traps the emissions produced from aircrafts and forms the supersaturated regions in the humid areas. These are characterized by the ice particle properties, such as size, concentration, extinction, ice water content, optical depth, geometrical depth, and cloud coverage etc., As per the studies it is known that the radiative effect of contrails is on par with or even greater than the CO2 emissions from airplanes. It is estimated that by 2050, the radiative forcing from global contrail cirrus may treble to around 160 m W m2. In the current study we are planning to detect the contrails based on the satellite image data and climatic data with respect to each image using deep learning techniques. We have decided on using the satellite image data from GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and successfully collected the data. By leveraging the deep learning techniques such as Upernet, Convnext model, image segmentation we seek to develop a model that can advance our understanding of the con- trail properties and their detection.
